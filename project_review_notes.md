# Stratos Brain Project Review Notes

## Key Findings from Meeting Notes (Jan 5, 2026)

### Project Overview
- **AI Technical Analysis Agent Dashboard** built using Vercel and integrated with GitHub for automatic updates
- Uses **Supabase database** to store 10 years of crypto data and 15 years of equity data
- Calculates daily technical features and signals based on technical analysis templates generated by **Gemini Pro**
- AI scores assets on two criteria:
  1. **Direction** (bullish/bearish)
  2. **Quality** (structural integrity/tradability)
- Provides context from 365 days of OHLCV data and 100+ technical indicators

### AI Agent Features
- Direction and quality scores (high structure score = clean setup)
- Outputs: targets, support/resistance, entry zones, invalidation levels
- Used for setting stops and taking profit

### Requested Enhancements (from Rennick Palley)
1. **Multi-column sorting** - ability to sort by "urgent" and "positive direction"
2. **TradingView integration** - embed charts in frontend
3. **Backtesting for reinforcement learning** - run model daily for last 5 years, compare predictions to actual outcomes over next month
4. **Additional data points**: sentiment, forward PE ratio, market cap, industry, description
5. **Memo generation agent** - generate research memos on stocks with fundamental narrative

### Architecture Vision
- Chat function as the "brain" with separate agents for:
  - Technical analysis
  - Sentiment analysis
- Dashboard allows querying information (volume to market cap ratio)
- Generate and attach files for learning about companies

### Current Limitations Noted
- Equities tab hard to use due to high volume (only top 500 run through AI scoring)
- Current output "everything looks bullish" - not helpful for selection
- Need better filtering mechanisms
