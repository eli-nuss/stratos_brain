# 2026-01-28 - ETF Pipeline Complete

## What We Built

Completed the full ETF analysis pipeline for Stratos Brain. Eli wanted:
1. **Separate ETF setup scanner** (not shared with equities)
2. **ETF AI signals** using same E2B/Gemini pattern as equities

## Files Created

### ETF Setup Scanner
- `jobs/etf_daily_setup_scanner.py` - 4 ETF-specific setups:
  - etf_trend_pullback_50ma
  - etf_oversold_bounce  
  - etf_breakout_confirmed
  - etf_golden_cross
- `.github/workflows/etf-daily-setup-scanner.yml` - triggers after ETF features

### ETF AI Signals (E2B Pattern)
- `scripts/run_etf_ai_analysis_batch.py` - Batch AI analysis with Gemini
- `scripts/e2b_etf_orchestrator.py` - Parallel sandbox orchestration
- `.github/workflows/etf-ai-signals-parallel.yml` - triggers after setup scanner

## Pipeline Flow
```
ETF OHLCV → ETF Features → ETF Setup Scanner → ETF AI Signals
```

## Key Distinction Clarified

**Simple Scoring** (what I built earlier):
- Rule-based: Trend (35%), Momentum (25%), Mean reversion (25%), Volume (15%)
- Fast, cheap, no AI
- Used for ranking

**AI Signals** (what I just built):
- Gemini AI with E2B sandboxes
- Qualitative analysis, sector/macro themes
- Same pattern as equity AI signals
- Expensive, used for deep insights

## Next Step
Need to clear bad ETF data and run the pipeline to populate everything.
